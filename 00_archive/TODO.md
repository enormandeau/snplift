# Things to do before publication

## Validation script
- Input files can be found
- Dependencies are met
- Scaffold names in old genome are the same as those in the input_file
- Scaffold name formats are OK in all input files
- Make SNPLift crash explicitly if one program crashes
- Bump to v1.0.0

## Put benchmark data and scripts online

## Revise MS
- Add references
- Publish on bioRxiv
- Submit to Bioinformatics - Application Notes

## Future improvements
- Add optional FastANI run to assess nucleotide distance between the genomes
- In collinearity exploration, add percentage after num bases
- Install deps in a conda environment `requirements.txt` file
