# Ideas for future improvements

- Make faster by splitting after mapping
- Install deps from a `requirements.txt` file
- In collinearity exploration, add percentage after number of collinear bases
- Use only center portion around SNP and find best marker position (sliding window)
- Could we cheat the program by adding FAKE SNPs on each side of real ones to confirm
  more of those that get discarded, especially for smaller datasets?
